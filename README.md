Plans and instructions to make your own CNC

Includes FreeCAD pieces, Gcode job, in case you have access to a CNC that can make 800mm x 800mm

Also includes the model assembled with sources, and the spreadsheet of measurements (included also inside cnc-pieces.FCStd)

The machine's volume by default is 300x300x300, resulting in a working area of around 193 x 136 x 50, but modifying the WorkingVolume 
values in the spreadsheet modifies on the fly the machine, although it's important then to re-check every measurement so that it makes
sense.
