# DIY CNC
Plans and instructions to make your own desktop CNC.

Includes FreeCAD pieces, assembly and Gcode job, in case you have access to a CNC that can make 800mm x 800mm.

Also includes the model assembled with sources, and the spreadsheet of measurements (included also inside cnc-pieces.FCStd)

This machine's outer volume by is around 300x300x250, resulting in a working area of around 210 x 140 x 50mm. Just modifying the WorkingVolume values in the spreadsheet modifies on the fly the machine, although it's important then to re-check every measurement so that it makes
sense.
